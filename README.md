# Kaleidoscope-ModRight

under construction

## TODO

1. basic functionality: require left and right shift key usage as
   based on passed in dictionary
2. extend to take an additional configuration element listing which
   modifiers should be enforced for "correctness" (shift, control,
   alt, gui)
3. extend to optionally flash LED (either specific key or whole
   keyboard) when "incorrect" modifier usage is seen
